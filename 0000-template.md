- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- RFC PR: [zkcrypto/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/zkcrypto/rfcs/pull/0000)
- Tracking Issue: [zkcrypto/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/zkcrypto/rfcs/issues/0000)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the relevant crates and
you were teaching it to another zkcrypto ecosystem developer. That generally
means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how zkcrypto ecosystem developers should *think* about the feature,
  and how it should impact the way they use the crates. It should explain the
  impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing
  zkcrypto ecosystem developers and new zkcrypto ecosystem developers.
- Discuss how this impacts the ability to read, understand, and maintain zkcrypto
  ecosystem code. Code is read and modified far more often than written; will the
  proposed feature make code easier to maintain?

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and
explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- Does the proposed change make zkcrypto ecosystem code easier or harder to
  read, understand, and maintain?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other crate ecosystems and what experience have
  their community had?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If
  you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed
  theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other crates, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us
whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other crates.

Note that while precedent set by other crates is some motivation, it does not on
its own motivate an RFC. Please also take into consideration that zkcrypto
sometimes intentionally diverges from common crate features.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature before publication in a crate release?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be
and how it would affect the zkcrypto ecosystem as a whole in a holistic way. Try
to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions
with the ecosystem in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the
roadmap for the relevant crates.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC
you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply
state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is
not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the
section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section
merely provides additional information.
